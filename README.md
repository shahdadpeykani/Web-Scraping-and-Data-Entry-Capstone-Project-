# Web-Scraping-and-Data-Entry-Capstone-Project-
This project demonstrates a web scraping tool built with BeautifulSoup and an automation script using Selenium.
I have created a bot that can scrape through the Zillow website in order to extract the address, price and link of the properties. It fills out the Google form automatically and provides spreadsheets from that data.
